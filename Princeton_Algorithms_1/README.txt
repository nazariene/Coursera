# Coursera
This contains homework for Coursera/Princeton's Algorithms I course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).

Not a 100% graded solution for several reasons:
1) Not generally right to post a perfectly working solutions for problems you are supposed to study yourself.
2) Too lazy :)

You can use this in case you are stuck with some problem and need a hint.
